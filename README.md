So far we (the trainees) have done two group assignments. 
The roles are divided among each other. 
In both assignments I was responsible for the front-end developer.

In the first group assignment, the pet rental, 
I was a scrumm master and the link between the front-end and back-end. 
The front end is built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

In the second group assignment, the hotel reservation application, 
I was also responsible for the front-end. 
This is largely built with JavaScript.
